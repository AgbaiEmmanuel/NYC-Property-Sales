# NYC-Property-Sales
A year's worth of properties sold on the NYC real estate market
## CONTEXT
This dataset is a record of every building or building unit (apartment, etc.) sold by the Real Estate company Knight Frank over a 12-month period.

### CONTENT
The dataset contains the location, address, type, sale price, and sale date of building units sold.  Many sales occur with a nonsensically small dollar amount: $0 most commonly. These sales are actually transfers of deeds between parties: for example, parents transferring ownership to their home to a child after moving out for retirement. This dataset uses the financial definition of a building/building unit, for tax purposes. In case a single entity owns the building in question, a sale covers the value of the entire building. In case a building is owned piecemeal by its residents (a condominium), a sale refers to a single apartment (or group of apartments) owned by some individual.
